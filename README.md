is a Chip-8 interpreter written in rust and drawn to the terminal using `ratatui`.

Inside `src/bin` is `oxid-cli`—a lighter version without a menu and useful for testing. You can load a ROM by passing its path as the first command-line argument (all others will be discarded). If no arguments are given, it will fallback to an `OXID_ROM` environment variable if set; it's recommended to use `realpath` with environment variables.
