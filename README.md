# `Oxid-8`

Oxid-8 is a Chip-8 interpreter written in rust and drawn to the terminal using `ratatui` as well as windowed natively and in the web with `wgpu`.

## Implementations

- `Oxid8` renders to the terminal using ratatui.
    > Inside `src/bin` is `oxid-cli`—a lighter version without a menu and useful for testing. You can load a ROM by passing its path as the first command-line argument (all others will be discarded). If no arguments are given, it will fallback to an `OXID_ROM` environment variable if set; it's recommended to use `realpath` with environment variables. This will be moved into the main `Oxid8` eventually.
- `Oxid8-wgpu` renders to a window both natively and in the web.
    > Native requires a positional argument as the rom path.
- `Oxid8-wasm` will likely be removed soon.
    > Replaced by Oxid8-wgpu.
- [`Oxid8-core`][oxid8-core] is the library crate that is used by `Oxid8` and `Oxid8-wgpu`.
    > Not currently stable, but it is intended for people to use in their own projects. Feel free to use `Oxid8` and `Oxid8-wgpu` as examples.

## Terminals that support the Kitty Keyboard Protocol 

> Most terminals do not differentiate key press, release, and repeat. [read more][Kitty Protocol]

- The alacritty terminal
- The ghostty terminal
- The foot terminal
- The iTerm2 terminal
- The rio terminal
- The WezTerm terminal

Non-kitty terminals are supported by clearing the virtual keyboard after each cycle. The result is playable, but noticeably worse.

## Sound

Sound in the tui is played by printing the bell character `\x07`. If you don't hear anything when you are expecting to, it's possible that you may have muted the bell.

## TODO

- merge tui renderer into main app
- fix web renderer
- chromatic abberation effect
- debug mode
- super chip-8 extension
- wgpu sound
